# Voice_Digitizer
Designing a Voice Digitizer using Microprocessor. 

This was a group project and is part of the course Microprocessor and Interfacing (CS F214) of BITS Goa.

Task: To design a voice digitizer

  Voice signal is to be digitized and reproduced with certain modification by the microprocessor. Output from a microphone is     sampled and digitized using an 8- bit ADC at the rate of 1000 samples per second.
  The output obtained from the microphone has been pre-processed inside the microphone to provide a signal varying in amplitude   between 0 – 5 V.
  The digitized signal is to be stored in RAM. The signal for a period of 6 seconds has to be digitized.
  The voice stored has to be reproduced with delay when user closes a switch labelled sound replay.
  The delay to be entered by the user are numbers from 1-9, with the help of a key-pad.
  The keypad has digits 0-9, backspace and enter.
  A seven segment display has to be provided with the keypad to display the delay value entered by the user.
  The delay is between samples – If value entered in is 5 then delay between two adjacent samples when reproduced is 5ms.
